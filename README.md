## 1
☑️: Compilation vs Interpretation 
Programs will depend on what do we want to develop
Compilation: Code/binary form/ ready to execute in the CPU  C. C++, Objective C
Interpretation: Source Code/ .exe convert each line to a binary  PHP, JavaScript, Java, C# Python
## 2
Java Compiled because source code is compiled into a binary byte-code.
Java Script is software-based Interpreter
