1

☑️: Compilation vs Interpretation Programs will depend on what do we want to develop Compilation: Code/binary form/ ready to execute in the CPU C. C++, Objective C, and will return an extra file (exe .ddl, etc) Interpretation: Source Code/ .exe convert each line to a binary PHP, JavaScript, Java, C# Python and will be read line by line each time it is called.
2

Java Compiled because source code is compiled into a binary byte-code. Java Script is software-based Interpreter

    Start
    Declare dolar = 7.60
    Declare localCurrency
    Read quetzal
    localCurrency = quetzal * dolar
    Print localCurrency
    End

const dolar = 7.60; var localCurrency; const monto = 70; localCurrency = (dolar * monto); console.log(localCurrency);
4

Pseudocode: "informal code" to write programs and one benefit is that we can write it in a language that we are familiar
5

Great way to start learning programing and will explain what each line in the program should do
6

    Start
    Declare age
    Read currentYear
    Read bornYear
    age = currentYear - bornYear
    Print age
    End

const currentYear = 2022; var age; const bornYear = 1975; age = (currentYear - bornYear); console.log(age);
